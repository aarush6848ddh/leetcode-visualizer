We first store the length of the original array in a variable.\n2. We convert the array to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements since sets can only contain unique values.\n3. We compare the original length with the set's length. If the original length is greater, it means duplicates were removed, indicating duplicates exist in the original array.\n\n**Why this works:**\nSets in Python only store unique elements. When we convert an array with duplicates to a set, Python automatically discards the duplicate values. By comparing lengths, we can detect if any duplicates were present:\n- If length > len(set): duplicates exist → return True\n- If length == len(set): all elements unique → return False\n\nThis approach is elegant because it lets Python's built-in data structure handle the duplicate detection automatically.`,\n    code: `class Solution:\n    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        length = len(nums)\n        my_set = set(nums)\n        if length > len(my_set):\n            return True\n        return False`,\n    timeComplexity: 'O(n)',\n    spaceComplexity: 'O(n)',\n    starred: false,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'valid-anagram',\n    title: 'Valid Anagram',\n    difficulty: 'Easy',\n    topics: ['Arrays & Hashing'],\n    status: 'solved',\n    leetcodeUrl: 'https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/',\n    explanation: `This solution checks if two strings are anagrams by sorting and comparing them.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Convert both strings s and t into lists of characters.\n2. Sort both lists lexicographically (alphabetically). When calling the sort function on a string converted to a list, Python sorts the characters in lexicographic (dictionary) order.\n3. Compare the sorted lists. If they are identical, the strings are anagrams.\n\n**Why this works:**\nAnagrams contain the exact same characters, just in different orders. When sorted lexicographically, both strings will produce the same sequence of characters.
