We first store the length of the original array in a variable.\n2. We convert the array to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements since sets can only contain unique values.\n3. We compare the original length with the set's length. If the original length is greater, it means duplicates were removed, indicating duplicates exist in the original array.\n\n**Why this works:**\nSets in Python only store unique elements. When we convert an array with duplicates to a set, Python automatically discards the duplicate values. By comparing lengths, we can detect if any duplicates were present:\n- If length > len(set): duplicates exist → return True\n- If length == len(set): all elements unique → return False\n\nThis approach is elegant because it lets Python's built-in data structure handle the duplicate detection automatically.`,\n    code: `class Solution:\n    def hasDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        length = len(nums)\n        my_set = set(nums)\n        if length > len(my_set):\n            return True\n        return False`,\n    timeComplexity: 'O(n)',\n    spaceComplexity: 'O(n)',\n    starred: false,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'valid-anagram',\n    title: 'Valid Anagram',\n    difficulty: 'Easy',\n    topics: ['Arrays & Hashing'],\n    status: 'solved',\n    leetcodeUrl: 'https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/',\n    videoUrl: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yShHLVskk',\n    explanation: `This solution checks if two strings are anagrams by first verifying their lengths, then sorting and comparing them.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. First, check if the lengths of strings s and t are equal. If they're not, they cannot be anagrams, so return False immediately.\n2. If the lengths are equal, sort both strings and compare them directly. In Python, sorted() can be called directly on strings, which returns a sorted list of characters.\n3. If the sorted strings are equal, the strings are anagrams → return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n**Why this works:**\nAnagrams must have the same length and contain the exact same characters, just in different orders. By sorting both strings, we normalize their character order, allowing for a direct comparison:\n- If lengths differ: cannot be anagrams → return False\n- If sorted strings are equal: strings are anagrams → return True\n- If sorted strings differ: strings are not anagrams → return False\n\nThe early length check is an optimization that avoids unnecessary sorting when the strings clearly cannot be anagrams.`,\n    code: `class Solution:\n    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:\n        if len(s) != len(t):\n            return False\n        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)`,\n    timeComplexity: 'O(n log n)',\n    spaceComplexity: 'O(n)',\n    starred: false,\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'two-sum',\n    title: 'Two Sum',\n    difficulty: 'Easy',\n    topics: ['Arrays & Hashing'],\n    status: 'solved',\n    leetcodeUrl: 'https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/',\n    videoUrl: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OgkjKhz8Io',\n    explanation: `This solution uses a hashmap (dictionary) to efficiently find two numbers that add up to the target.\n\n**How it works:**\n1.

'https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/',\n        explanation: `This solution checks if a string is a palindrome by filtering to alphanumeric characters, converting to lowercase, and comparing with its reversed version.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Filter the string to keep only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers), removing spaces, punctuation, and special characters.\n2. Convert the filtered string to lowercase to ignore case differences.\n3. Compare the lowercase string with its reversed version. If they are identical, the string is a palindrome.\n\n**Why this works:**\nA palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters. By filtering and normalizing the string, we can directly compare it with its reverse:\n- If string == reversed: palindrome → return True\n- If string != reversed: not a palindrome → return False\n\nThis approach is straightforward and leverages Python's string manipulation capabilities.`,\n        code: `class Solution:\n    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:\n        new_s = \"\".join([char for char in s if char.isalnum()])\n        lower_s = new_s.lower()\n        print(lower_s)\n        if lower_s[::-1] == lower_s:\n            return True\n        return False`,\n        timeComplexity: 'O(n)',\n        spaceComplexity: 'O(n)',\n        starred: false,\n      },\n      {\n        id: 'two-integer-sum-ii',\n        title: 'Two Integer Sum II',\n        difficulty: 'Medium',\n        topics: ['Two Pointers'],\n        status: 'solved',\n        leetcodeUrl: 'https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/',\n        explanation: `This solution uses a hashmap (dictionary) to efficiently find two numbers that add up to the target in a sorted array.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Initialize an empty hashmap to store numbers and their indices as we iterate through the array.\n2. For each number at index i, calculate the difference (diff = target - n) needed to reach the target.\n3. Check if this difference already exists in the hashmap. If it does, we've found our pair - return the stored index of the difference and the current index, both incremented by 1 for 1-indexing.\n4. If the difference doesn't exist in the hashmap, store the current number and its index in the hashmap for future lookups.\n\n**Why this works:**\nBy storing each number we've seen along with its index, we can check in constant time O(1) if its complement (the number needed to reach the target) has already been encountered. Since the array is sorted, we can efficiently find pairs:\n- Without hashmap: O(n²) time complexity (checking all pairs)\n- With hashmap: O(n) time complexity (single pass through array)\n\nThe solution returns 1-indexed positions as required by the problem.`,\n        code: `class Solution:\n    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:\n        my_hashmap = {}\n
